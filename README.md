# JobNimbusExam

This solution contains 2 projects ie a Console project for the main solution to the exam and a Test project for the test scenarios.

## To see how this works:
1. Clone this repository.
2. The projects target .NET 6.0, so I recommend opening the solution with Visual Studio 2022 if possible, or with Visual Studio 2019 version 16.11 or later.
3. Build and run the console project or the test project to see the results.
